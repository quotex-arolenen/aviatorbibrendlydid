In this article, we will explore the issue of whether or not Quotex is
halal. We will also provide a comprehensive guide to using the Quotex
platform, including instructions on how to register, deposit funds, and
place trades.

## Is Quotex Halal?

According to the principles of Islamic Sharia law, gambling and usurious
banking are prohibited. Binary options trading is a form of gambling, as
it involves risking money on the outcome of a future event. As such,
some scholars have argued that binary options trading is haram.

However, other scholars have argued that binary options trading is
halal, provided that the trader does not engage in gambling or usurious
banking. These scholars argue that binary options trading is a
legitimate form of investment, as it is based on the trader\'s knowledge
and skill.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not Quotex is halal is a matter
of personal opinion. However, it is important to note that the platform
does not offer any features that are specifically designed to appeal to
Muslim traders.
